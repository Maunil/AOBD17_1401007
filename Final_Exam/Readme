The code has been designed independently for two modules

The final Algorithm code 

For Module 1 
Two Cases 
1) Algorithm/Output1_1.py 
2) Algorithm/Output1_2.py


For Module 2 
1) Algorithm/Output2_1.py 
2) Algorithm/Output2_2.py


The data processing related codes are kept individually with processed data in Data_Clean_Module 1 and Data_Clean_Module 2 Folders 

Outputs of the codes are also kept in Algorithm/Output/Output1.txt and Output2.txt, assosiated inputs are kept in Algorithm/new_user.txt 
and new_user_2.txt
